				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>From interpersonal conversation to national president campaign, the idea is to communicate so that people would listen and care. In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump, who was widely underetimated as a candidate, had no political experience,
					set of outrageous claims, and threatened his opponent, has surprisely won his victory.</p>
				<p>How Trump attract his audience has brought researchers attention. Focusing on Trump's speaking style, and referring to Chip and Dan's book <i>Made to Stick</i>, one of the ways in which Trump deliveries his message is through<strong> simplicity</strong>.
					From this website, we hope you will be able to understand the meaning of simplicity and the component of a simple statement, and to try some exercise below. </p>

				<h4>Simplicity</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Simple messages are core and compact. </strong>What we mean by "simple" is finding the core of the idea. Saying something short is not the mission. We must create ideas that are both simple and profound.The Golden Rule is the ultimate model
					of simplicity: a one-sentence statement so profound that an individual could spend a lifetime learning to follow it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<!--Content-Core-->
			<div class="row" id="core">
				<section class="col-sm-12">
					<h4>Core</h4>
					<p>
						We must relentlessly <strong>prioritize</strong>. Prioritization help people identify core messages, and prevent from making irrational decisions under too much complex and uncertain situation. Here are some suggestions from the book:<br> 1. You
						prioritize critical goals over beneficial goals.<br> 2. In a paragraph, your first sentence is the lead, which contains the most important information. <br> 3. When you say three things, you say nothing.
					</p>
				</section>
			</div>

			<!--Content-Compact-->
			<div class="row" id="compact">
				<section class="col-sm-12">
					<h4>Compact</h4>
					<p>
						The second aspect of simplicity is compact. Compactness means to reduce the amount of information in an idea. Meanwhile, we also need to assure that compactness contains the core value. Here are some suggestions from the book:<br> 1. Use <strong>proverb</strong>.
						Proverbs are short sentences shared standards of norms. They are simple yet profound.<br> 2. Use <strong>schema</strong>. Psychologists define schema as a collection of generic properties of a concept or category that stored in our memories. Schema
						helps comprehension and memorization.<br> 3. Use generative <strong>metaphor</strong>.
